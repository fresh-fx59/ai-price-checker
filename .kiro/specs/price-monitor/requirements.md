# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a price monitoring application that tracks product prices from web URLs. The system parses product information (name, price, image) from web pages, stores this data, and monitors for price changes. When prices drop, it sends email notifications to users. The application runs in Docker and is configured through property files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add product URLs to monitor, so that I can track price changes for items I'm interested in purchasing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a URL THEN the system SHALL validate the URL format and accessibility
2. WHEN a valid URL is added THEN the system SHALL parse and extract product name, price, and image
3. WHEN product information is successfully extracted THEN the system SHALL store the product data with timestamp
4. IF a URL cannot be parsed or accessed THEN the system SHALL log an error and notify the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically check prices daily, so that I don't have to manually monitor price changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the daily check runs THEN the system SHALL fetch current product information from all stored URLs
2. WHEN current price data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL compare it with the previously stored price
3. WHEN a price comparison is completed THEN the system SHALL update the stored price data with timestamp
4. IF a URL becomes inaccessible THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other URLs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive email notifications when prices drop, so that I can take advantage of lower prices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a current price is lower than the stored price THEN the system SHALL send an email notification
2. WHEN sending an email THEN the system SHALL include product name, old price, new price, and product URL
3. WHEN an email is sent successfully THEN the system SHALL log the notification event
4. IF email sending fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry according to configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure the application through property files, so that I can customize settings without modifying code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from property files
2. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL validate all required settings are present
3. WHEN email settings are configured THEN the system SHALL include SMTP server, credentials, and recipient settings
4. WHEN monitoring settings are configured THEN the system SHALL include check frequency and retry policies
5. IF required configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL fail to start with clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to run in Docker, so that I can deploy it easily across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker container starts THEN the system SHALL initialize all required services and dependencies
2. WHEN the container is running THEN the system SHALL execute scheduled price checks according to configuration
3. WHEN the container stops THEN the system SHALL gracefully shutdown and save any pending data
4. WHEN configuration files are mounted THEN the system SHALL use the external configuration instead of defaults

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and manage my monitored products, so that I can see what I'm tracking and remove items I'm no longer interested in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request to view products THEN the system SHALL display a list of all monitored products with basic information
2. WHEN I select a specific product THEN the system SHALL show detailed information including current price, previous price, and lowest price
3. WHEN I choose to delete a product THEN the system SHALL remove it from monitoring and delete associated price history
4. WHEN I delete a product THEN the system SHALL confirm the deletion and update the product list
5. IF no products are being monitored THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually update product prices, so that I can correct inaccurate automated parsing or add manual price checks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a product to update THEN the system SHALL allow me to enter a new price value
2. WHEN I submit a manual price update THEN the system SHALL validate the price format and save it with timestamp
3. WHEN a manual price is lower than previous prices THEN the system SHALL update the lowest price record
4. WHEN a manual price update is saved THEN the system SHALL update the price history and display confirmation
5. IF the manual price format is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow correction

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to track price history including previous and lowest prices, so that I can see price trends and the best deals over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new price is recorded THEN the system SHALL store it as the current price and move the previous current price to price history
2. WHEN comparing prices THEN the system SHALL maintain the lowest price ever recorded for each product
3. WHEN displaying product details THEN the system SHALL show current price, previous price, and lowest price with timestamps
4. WHEN a new lowest price is detected THEN the system SHALL update the lowest price record
5. WHEN price history is requested THEN the system SHALL provide chronological price data for analysis

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to use AI/parsing tools to extract product information, so that it can handle various website formats automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a product page is accessed THEN the system SHALL attempt to parse product information using multiple strategies
2. WHEN parsing with AI tools THEN the system SHALL extract product name, price, and image URL from page content
3. WHEN parsing fails with one method THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative parsing strategies
4. WHEN all parsing methods fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting
5. WHEN product information is extracted THEN the system SHALL validate the data format and completeness
